Longitudinal Multiomics analysis 

A longitudinal study on Multi-omics data to create multivariate predictive models was the main goal of the current study. 
Integrating the different omics available on a single platform to make the research goal more efficient was considered during this
study. 

Predictive analytics was performed on the biological modules in multi-omic network models. 
Technological advancements enable multiple biological modalities to be a source of data being generated for research purposes. 
Integrative analysis that use information that is gathered from these data modalities assure to deliver more comprehensive insights into the biological systems under study.
These biological advances in science provide unusual opportunities to discover patterns and dive into the phase of pregnancy to understand the process more clearly. 
Differentiating the normal pregnancy phenomena with some complications associated during pregnancy considering different biological assays is investigated in the studies.

Biological components like proteomic, genomic, microbiome, transcriptomic, etc are used as datasets for the current longitudinal analysis.
Combining these omics to generate better multivariate predictive models for accurate results was the research focus.
Performing analysis on individual omics datasets and also by combining all the available omics datasets we could infer that few datasets contributed more and some of them were not helpful in the analysis to a greater extent. 
Different multivariate models were implemented to deduce which produced more accurate results. 
Therefore, multiple strategies were tested on individual omics level as well as after integrating omics for predicting the gestational ages during pregnancy. 
Trying multiple models also helped us identify the most accurate models.
